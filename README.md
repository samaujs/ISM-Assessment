# Information Security Management Assessment

- A global organization's corporate CISO plans to make use of ISO 27001, and related security standards to implement a security and technology resiliency assessment of its subsidiary companies. Describe how you would go about doing this as the information security specialist of the corporate security team. Using ISO 27001 and related standards, design a method to enable the assessment and benchmarking of the subsidiary companies to be made in an ongoing basis. Consider also the metrics that you will use to measure status and changes in the information security management posture of the subsidiary companies over time, and scenarios of its use and decisions/actions that it may help to support.
- Use spreadsheet to capture data, compute the measurements, and produce suitable reports and visualizations to enable management decisions to be made based on the assessments and benchmarking made.
